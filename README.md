##TIDLE: TI-BASIC Editor

TIDLE is a TI-BASIC editor and interpreter.  It can create TI-BASIC programs that can then be saved and transferred to TI-83 and TI-84 series calculators where they can be run.  It can create new files or open and modify current files, whether they were created in the editor or on a calculator.  It can also save files as text files or Python files.  There is also an interpreter that will interpret your TI-BASIC code and run it in the command prompt.

####File Menu

The "File" menu allows you to create a new file, open a file, or save a file.  Selecting "Run Interpreter" will interpret your TI-BASIC code and run the interpreter.  The interpreter only supports a handful of commands (including many of the prgm, math, and list commands) and will return an error if an unsupported command is used.  Selecting "Exit" will prompt you to save any unsaved work and then exit the program.


####Edit Menu

The "Edit" menu allows you to perform the usual edit commands including undo, redo, cut, copy, paste, select all, and delete.  Selecting "Find" allows you to search for some text in your code.  Selecting "Replace" allows you to replace the next occurence of some text or replace all occurences of some text.


####Commands Menu

The "Commands" menu allows you to insert commands.  This is useful for commands that may not be able to be coded using the keyboard.  The commands are sorted by the menus in which they appear on the calculator.


####The Options Menu

The "Options" menu allows you to change certian options.  The "Syntax Coloring" check box allows you to turn the syntax coloring on or off.  Selecting "Command Color" or "String Color" allows you to change the syntax color for calculator commands or strings.


####The Help Menu

The "Help" menu provides a link to the TI-BASIC developer web site where there is detailed information about each command, including what arguements they take.


####The Program Bar

The "Program Name" entry box allows you to select the name of your TI-BASIC program.  TI-BASIC program names must consist of letters and numbers, begin with a letter, and be no longer than 8 characters.  The "Protected" check box allows you to specify whether or not the program is protected, meaning that it will be unable to be edited on a calculator.  The buttons provide shortcuts to inserting frequently used commands.


####The Status Bar

The status bar displays the current line and column of the cursor.
